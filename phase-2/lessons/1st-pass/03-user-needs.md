# Conducting needs assessments

Conduct internal and external needs assessments for the stakeholders identified earlier. It would be good to have both **user needs** and some **product objectives**.

The two questions that must be answered at this level are:

1. What do we (the creators of this software) want to get out of it?
2. What do our **users** want to get out of it?

The leader does this quickly for the example project, then the rest do assessments for their own sites.

## User needs

Discuss the needs of the various users - users who need the function, the media, etc. For this project, we will focus only on the needs of colleagues. These needs include:

### Myself

1. Create the new idea
2. Obtain a link to share to friends
3. Friends could come in and comment either annoymously or with name
4. Register a user, login
5. Logged-in user would be able to subscribe the update

Eventually, we want to extend this to become a voting system where the user can vote for valuable projects.

## Product objectives

Our site is being created as a training exercise, so we'll have objectives related to that. In a production application, these would probably not apply.

### Training objectives

1. Learn basic Ruby on Rails
2. Learn MVC, RESTful, CRUD the Rails way
3. Learn BDD using Rails
4. Improve facility with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, REST, etc.
5. See another project through from start to finish
6. Apply these new skills in a personal project (which may be for production deployment)

### Production objectives

1. Develop a valuable user base
2. Build a large database of user-generated data
3. Targeted advertising
4. Fast, scalable, robust, and efficient (to save money)

## Successful completion

The team should have identified many potential user needs and product objectives for their own projects.
