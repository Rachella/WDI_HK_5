# Defining the stakeholders

Lead the team in a discussion of internal and external stakeholders. Encourage everyone to think beyond the obvious.

## Exercise

After the class identifies the stakeholders for the example project, have the students list the stakeholders for their own projects, then share them with the class. Discuss.

Below are examples of stakeholders for the URL Shortener project.

### External stakeholders

1. Myself want to mark down the ideas I have
2. Friends that share my ideas and make comments
3. Other people can vote for the ideas
4. The media
5. Curious onlookers (future users?)

### Internal stakeholders

1. The site owner
2. The developers
3. The testers
4. The marketers

## Successful completion

Each one should have developed a list of stakeholders for his or her project.
