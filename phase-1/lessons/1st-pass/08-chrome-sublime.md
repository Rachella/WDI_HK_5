### Inspector tool

- Elements for HTML source code
- Network
- Resources
- Console for displaying `console.log`

## Sublime

Sublime is the tool that many developers use, it has the ability to add package, which provides additional tools when needed. One can customize the environment to whatever he wants, but there are still some common packages, like hightlighter or linter.
