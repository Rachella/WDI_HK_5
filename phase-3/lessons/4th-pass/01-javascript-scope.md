# Scope in JavaScript

## Motivation

Understanding scope is important because much of the JavaScript code we write is executed asynchronously. We create functions that are not executed immediately, but rather when some event occurs, such as the user clicking an element or an HTTP request finishing. Therefore, we need to understand how JavaScript variables are shared between functions and what data a function has access to when it is called.
