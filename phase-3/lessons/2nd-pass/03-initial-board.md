# Initial HTML / CSS

We're going to build a quick prototype of website in stages while the team watch with laptops closed. After each stage is complete, we'll do a git commit and push. Then everyone will do the same. We'll iterate until we have the prototype ready.

This process is to convert the wireframe into HTML/CSS prototype.

- Open the application layout
- Link up the Bootstrap
- Set the color scheme

## Exercise

Begin with a minimal page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>PepperLunch</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header role="banner">
      <h1>Pepper Lunch Tracker</h1>
    </header>
    <main role="main">

    </main>
    <footer>

    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

Preview the page, then do a commit and push with a message such as "Added base html."

## Successful completion

Everyone has a basic HTML page (as do we).
